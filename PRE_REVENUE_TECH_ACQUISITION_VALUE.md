**Applied to TruckFlow:** $4.7M x 10-15 = $47-70M

### Risk-Adjusted Value
**Buyer considerations:**
- No revenue validation (-40% discount)
- No customer traction (-30% discount)  
- Technology complexity (+20% premium)
- Market opportunity (+50% premium)
- First-mover advantage (+30% premium)

**Net Adjustment:** +30% = $61-91M potential
