## Revenue Model (Personal Income)

### Target: $10K-15K Monthly Personal Profit

**Daily Operations:**
- Process 20-40 loads per day
- Average profit: $200-400 per load
- Daily revenue: $4K-16K
- Monthly gross: $120K-480K
- Your take (10% margin): $12K-48K profit

**Conservative Estimate:**
- 25 loads/day × $300 profit × 30 days = $225K monthly gross
- Your margin: $22.5K monthly profit
- Annual personal income: $270K

## Simplified Architecture

### Core System Components
```javascript
// Essential services only
const services = {
  loadScanner: 'Scan major load boards every 30 seconds',
  profitCalculator: 'Calculate margins and opportunities',
  autoBooker: 'Book profitable loads instantly',
  carrierMatcher: 'Match loads with available carriers',
  paymentTracker: 'Track payments and settlements'
};
```

### Database Schema (Minimal)
```sql
-- Just the essentials
loads (id, origin, destination, rate, cost, profit, status)
carriers (id, name, contact, rates, availability)
bookings (id, load_id, carrier_id, profit_margin, status)
payments (id, booking_id, amount, status, date)
```

### Tech Stack (Lightweight)
```
Backend: Node.js + Express
Database: PostgreSQL (small instance)
Frontend: Simple React dashboard
APIs: Load board APIs only
No AI models: Use rule-based logic
```

---

## Automation Workflow

### 1. Load Scanning (Every 30 seconds)
```javascript
// Scan for profitable opportunities
const profitableLoads = await scanLoadBoards({
  minProfit: 200,
  maxDistance: 500,
  preferredLanes: ['TX-CA', 'FL-NY', 'IL-TX']
});
```

### 2. Profit Calculation
```javascript
// Simple profit logic
const calculateProfit = (load) => {
  const marketRate = load.rate;
  const carrierCost = findBestCarrierRate(load);
  const profit = marketRate - carrierCost - fees;
  return profit > 200 ? { profitable: true, profit } : null;
};
```

### 3. Automated Booking
```javascript
// Auto-book if profitable
if (profit > minimumProfit) {
  await bookLoad(load);
  await assignCarrier(bestCarrier);
  await sendConfirmations();
  logProfit(profit);
}
```
