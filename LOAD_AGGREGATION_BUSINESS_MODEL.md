# Load Aggregation Business Model - Middleman Revenue Strategy

## ðŸŽ¯ BUSINESS MODEL OVERVIEW

Your platform acts as the **intelligent middleman** between major load boards and drivers, providing massive value while generating substantial recurring revenue.

### How It Works:
1. **You subscribe** to major load boards (DAT, Truckstop, CH Robinson)
2. **You aggregate** all their loads into one intelligent platform
3. **Drivers pay you** a single subscription instead of multiple expensive ones
4. **You profit** from the spread while drivers save hundreds monthly
