### Demo Script (5-minute version)

"Welcome to TruckFlow AI. In the next 5 minutes, I'll show you how AI can transform your dispatch operations.

[Screen 1: Dashboard Overview]
This is our comprehensive dashboard showing real-time metrics for a 100-truck fleet. Notice the live updates - every 30 seconds we're getting new data from IoT sensors across the entire fleet.

[Screen 2: AI Rate Optimization]  
Here's our AI rate optimizer in action. I'll input a load from Dallas to Denver. Watch as the AI analyzes market conditions, fuel prices, and seasonal demand... There - it suggests $2,847 instead of the broker's offer of $2,450. That's $397 more profit in 15 seconds.

[Screen 3: IoT Monitoring]
Every truck has IoT sensors providing real-time data. GPS location, fuel levels, engine diagnostics, driver behavior. This truck in Phoenix just triggered a maintenance alert - the AI predicts brake pad replacement needed in 500 miles.

[Screen 4: Voice Commands]
Let me show you voice control. 'TruckFlow, find loads from Chicago to Nashville.' See? Natural language processing understands context and responds intelligently.

[Screen 5: ROI Calculator]
Finally, here's your potential ROI. For a 50-truck fleet, TruckFlow AI typically generates $1.2 million additional annual profit. The platform pays for itself in 6 weeks.
